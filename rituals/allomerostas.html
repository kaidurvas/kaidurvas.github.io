      <h3>The Tablet of Allomerostas</h3>
<p>
The Tablet of Allomerostas is a monolithic slab of volcanic blackstone preserved by layers of ash deep under the seas that sank the Riz-Leutheria archipelago. It is a strange relic, attributed of course to Phoibos given its symbols, metaphors and language, but whose subject matter concerns the mind of Ultor as discovered by the experiment of Phaistos. So Phoibos himself has very little to do with the content, though he invented the blend of angular glyphic geometry, animal sigils, and sparse words written in a proto-script. The below is the result of a hundred generations of the cult of Phoibos painstakingly reconstructing its meaning.
</p>

<h4>The Lost Message</h4>
<p>
The top row is three concentric circles. The outer circle is made of fractal hexagons, considered the Field of Perception. The middle circle is made of spiralling triangles, considered the Stream of Attention. The inner circle is a single white dot, considered the Core of Witnessing.
</p>

<p>
The center column has 7 stacked animal-sigils, each accompanied by an abstract glyph showing pattern density (thought to be dullness/energy) and flow lines (thought to be distraction/balance/focus). The sigils are those of a fish (dull and distracted), a tortoise (dull and balanced), a serpent (dull and focused), a monkey (energetic and distracted), a lion (energetic and balanced), and an eagle (energetic and focused). The seventh is a creature not of this world, and is considered the sigil for Ultor himself.
</p>

<p>
The right side of the tablet has a series of words whose meanings we can only guess at. Each word is a gate, opening a rhythm in the mind.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monaisma</strong> ‚Äì the singular breath, the atom of awareness: the first unbroken moment</li>
<li><strong>Aprostasis</strong> ‚Äì that which commands nothing: the unled emergence of mental content</li>
<li><strong>Skindapsos</strong> ‚Äì the slicing scatter: when attention splits and consumes itself</li>
<li><strong>Lathostrophe</strong> ‚Äì the turning of forgetting: when the object fades but the gesture persists</li>
<li><strong>Kellidron</strong> ‚Äì the slack thread: a dulled moment sagging from presence</li>
<li><strong>Elachnaphaos</strong> ‚Äì the least light: the moment before perception extinguishes</li>
<li><strong>Anastrpesis</strong> ‚Äì the re-turning: when awareness realigns with the object</li>
<li><strong>Diapsechon</strong> ‚Äì that which bridges the breaks: the continuity that spans moments</li>
<li><strong>Analogon</strong> ‚Äì the rising ratio: the rhythmic shape that clarity takes</li>
<li><strong>Synkleidos</strong> ‚Äì form locked with form: moments linking perfectly, each echoing the last</li>
<li><strong>Allomerostas</strong> ‚Äì deep occupation elsewhere: the intense focus of the War-God Ultor</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Reconstructed Edicts</h4>
<p>From these, we reconstruct the 16 drumbeats of the War-God Ultor‚Äôs Focus</p>

<h4>Section I: Ontogenesis ‚Äì Structure of Mind</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>ìÇÄ There is no mind. Only moments</li>
  <li>ìÇÄ A moment may perceive. Or not.</li>
  <li>ìÇÄ What is perceived may be the object of focus. Or not.</li>
  <li>ìÇÄ The object of focus may be held. Or not.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Section II: Katabasis ‚Äì Descent of Mind</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>‚üÅ Perception creates energy. Energy creates distraction. Distraction loses energy to dullness. Dullness loses perception.</li>
  <li>‚üÅ Not-perception can be blindness, sleep, unconsciousness, death, and one more that is not known.</li>
  <li>‚üÅ What is known can be forgotten. But what is forgotten can be recalled. To return is the root of training.</li>
  <li>‚üÅ What is sharp may fade. But what is faded may sharpen. To return is the root of training.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Section III: Anabasis ‚Äì Return of Mind</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>ê∞¥ A moment re-establishes contact.</li>
  <li>ê∞¥ A distraction recognized is labelled.</li>
  <li>ê∞¥ Balance neither forces nor drifts.</li>
  <li>ê∞¥ The witness sees without grasping.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Section IV: Metastasis ‚Äì Mastery of Mind</h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>‚ú∂ Moments are linked in a chain of continuity.</li>
  <li>‚ú∂ Absorption without wavering closes the portal to the Underworld.</li>
  <li>‚ú∂ The Moment of Mind is not a container but a wave.</li>
  <li>‚ú∂ There is no arrival, only refinement, until Allomerostas: the shape of no-change, the focus of the War-God Ultor.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Experiment of Phaistos / The Temple of Ultor</h3>
<p>
Phaistos, the God of the Forge, built the first Temple of Ultor, his only friend. In reality, they built it together, for Phaistos designed the space and Ultor provided the energy that together created the edifice that we now call a Temple. They simply built, for the Gods‚Äô purpose is alignment and connection. The two connected and aligned the material space of stone and the liminal space of the mind, seeking to invert that last hidden realm in the world. The sanctum has 3 layers: the resonant core, the concentric lattice, and the inner vault of Ultor.
</p>

<h4>The Resonant Core</h4>
<p>
A spherical chamber made from a single crystal of an alloy not found anywhere else on this earth‚Äîobsidian, quartz, and silver. The black crystal holds stone-borne memory, singing under the pressure of the mind and translating attention into movement.
</p>

<h4>The Concentric Lattice</h4>
<p>
108 hexagonal plates of quartz interlaced with sapphire veins and a core of gold-threaded ceramic, recording minute shifts in ambient field pressure.
</p>

<h4>The Inner Vault</h4>
<p>
At the geometric and ontological center of the Temple, surrounded by layers of harmonic architecture yet untouched by glyph, metal, or stone. A hollow sphere of void-glass encloses a vacuum-shell, suspended by tension rings that never touch. To approach is to feel one‚Äôs being dissolve. It is the shape of madness.
</p>

<p>
Ultor sits inside, waiting patiently for Phaistos to seal it in.
</p>

<h4>The Experiment</h4>
<p>
The Vault is the source of Null Sympathy‚Äîso perfectly receptive it is invisible to will. Ultor‚Äôs mind presses outward, imprinting its shape on the negative mold of intention. Internal flux‚Äîwavering, forgetting, returning, focusing‚Äîcreates ripples like heat in water. Phaistos links each plate to a temporal grid, isolating slices of attention.
</p>

<p>
Black square: weight but no motion‚Äîcontainment, lifeless stability.<br>
Red circle: radiant but uncentered‚Äîscattered, turbulent arcs.<br>
White triangle: sharp, directional, unified‚Äîmaximum clarity.
</p>

<p>
Ultor wakes from absence and reaches Allomerostas. 8 plates remain. Phaistos captures 200 moments‚Äî100 plates, double-sided. The experiment lasts 0.52 seconds.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the Temple have since been studied by the cults of Ultor, Phaistos, and especially Phoibos. It is Phoibos‚Äôs followers who cleaned, layered, and rendered the walls of the experiment into tablets‚Äîslowing down the mind of Ultor so the mind of man could understand it.
</p>

<h4>The Projection</h4>
<p>
This is the result of those tablets. Slowed down by 100X. Every triangle, circle, and square represents a fixed snapshot of the attention plate. The trendlines mirror sequential harmonic analysis: the ratio of perceiving moments (<em>clarity</em>) and the ratio of focused moments (<em>steadiness</em>).
